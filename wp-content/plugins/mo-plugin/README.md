# Mo Plugin 

A WordPress.org boilerplate plugin based on [best practices](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/the-basics/best-practices/).

It is taylor made to the `Mo Pro Theme` which means it's functionality is defined by the feature requests coming from the theme. On its own, without the theme enabled, the plugin does nothing. 

## Best practices
